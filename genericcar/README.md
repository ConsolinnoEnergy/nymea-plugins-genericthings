# Generic car

This plugin allows to add a generic electric car in nymea. Such things don't have any
functionality on their own, but allow to create a visually appealing experience when
using general purpose input and outputs, such as GPIOs or MQTT.

## Set-up

First, set up a thing with generic inputs or outputs. For instance from the MQTT client plugin.
When done, set up the generic car and use nymea scripts to process incoming messages and
fill the cars states accordingly.

# Generic thing

This plugin allows to create generic things in nymea. Such things don't have any
functionality on their own, but allow to create a general purpose thing to hold
various data obtained from other general purpose inputs and outputs, such as GPIOs
or MQTT.

## Set-up

Set up a generic thing and use the things settings to connect the inputs or outputs or
use nymea scripts to fill in data in the generic thing.

# Generic energy devices

This plugin allows to create generic energy related things in nymea. Such things don't have any
functionality on their own, but allow to create a visually appealing experience when
using general purpose input and outputs, such as GPIOs or MQTT.

## Set-up

First, set up a thing with generic inputs or outputs. For instance from the GPIO or MQTT plugins.
When done, set up the desired generic thing and use the things settings to connect
the inputs and/or outputs or nymea scripts to fill in the thing states accordingly.
